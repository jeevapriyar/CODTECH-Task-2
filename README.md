# Overview of the Project

## Project Name: VULNERABILITY SCANNING TOOL
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecbe71c6-d8ae-4826-b3ab-f7167fc39628)


## Objective
The Advanced Vulnerability Scanner is a Python tool designed to identify and report vulnerabilities in network services and websites. It helps users enhance their security posture by providing detailed insights into open ports, running services, outdated software, and website security headers.

## Key Activities
Scanning network targets for open ports and services.
Detecting the versions of running services.
Identifying outdated software packages.
Scanning websites for common vulnerabilities using Nikto.
Checking website security headers for best practices.

## Technology Used
**Python**: The primary programming language used to develop the tool.
**Nmap**: A network scanning tool used to detect open ports and service versions.
**Pip**: A package management system used to check for outdated software packages.
**Nikto**: A web server scanner used to identify common vulnerabilities on websites.
**Requests**: A Python library used to send HTTP requests and analyze response headers.

## Key Insights
**Open Ports**: Identifying open ports helps in understanding the attack surface of a network.
**Service Versions**: Detecting running services and their versions aids in identifying potentially vulnerable software.
**Outdated Software**: Keeping software packages up-to-date is crucial for maintaining security.
**Website Vulnerabilities**: Regularly scanning websites for vulnerabilities helps in mitigating potential attacks.
**Security Headers**: Implementing security headers like X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and X-Content-Type-Options enhances website security.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository** or download the script.
2. **Ensure you have Python and the necessary tools** (Nmap, Nikto, Requests) installed on your system.
3. **Run the script in your terminal or command prompt**:
    ```sh
    python vulnerability_scanner.py
    ```
4. **Follow the on-screen prompts** to enter the target IP or URL and specify the output file name.

## Sample Usage
```sh
python vulnerability_scanner.py
Enter target IP or URL: http://example.com
Enter the output file name (e.g., output.txt): output.txt
